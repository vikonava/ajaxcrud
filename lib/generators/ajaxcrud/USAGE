Description:
    Creates a very nice ajax-based scaffold for a model.

Example:
    rails g ajaxcrud NAME [field:type:boolean field:type:boolean]

    NAME - is the name of the model that is going to be built

    FIELD - the name of the attribute
    TYPE - the type of the attribute (string, integer, date, float, text, etc)
    BOOLEAN - true if it's going to be indexed in the search field (default = false)

    Creating table Person with attributes name, address, website and phone number indexing only name and website on the search field:
    
    rails g ajaxcrud Person name:string:true address:text website:string:true phone_number:string

    This will create:
        db/migrate/{timestamp}_create_{name}.rb
	app/models/{name}.rb
	test/unit/{name}_test.rb
	test/fixtures/{name}.yml
